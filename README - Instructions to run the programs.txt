Both Server and Client codes were written using PYTHON 3.3. To run the code it is mandatory to have PYTHON 3.x installed in the system. Since some features of PYTHON 3.x are not available in previous versions of PYTHON, the program will not work as expected if not interpreted using PYTHON 3.x.

BUILD and EXECUTION:
--------------------------
PYTHON codes are intepreted and hence compilation is not necessary. Both the server and the client need to be started as follows.
1. Open the command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory where the server and the client programs are available
3. In the console, type "py server.py" (without quotes). The server will now be started.
4. In another console, type "py client.py". The client program starts and provides options to choose from.

The procedure to proceed with the client and server are provided in the Manual document attached submitted in the project I. It contains screenshots of UI for running the client and the server.
